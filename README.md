# SolsticeChallenge

## This projects is a Code Challenge for Solstice

• It shows a list of contacts fetched, if necessary, from the network and then persists them in a database using an Android Architecture Component called Room.

• If the user downloads the data and then closes the app, when he reenters then the data won't be downloaded from the network but fetched from the database instead.

• A button to remove all contacts was added to the Main Activity (the one which displays the contact list).

• Also the user can refresh the contacts by pulling down in the Main Activity.

### Several Pull Requests where created in order to provide the app with small pieces of functionality. After a review they were finally merged in master.
